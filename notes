* A heuristic for replacing an entity
    - A similarity score is calculated by counting the number of component bits
      in common with the entity preceding the slot under examination.
    - In case multiple entities need to be added, they are inserted to the place
      with currently the best similarity score.
    - The insertion is done in descending order of active dataset size of the
      entity (the sum of the sizes of the active components).
